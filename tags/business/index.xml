      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every economy exists in a delicate balance between growth and stability. Central banks and governments play critical roles in maintaining this balance, acting as the guardians of their nation&amp;rsquo;s financial health. However, their responsibilities often seem to contradict each other. On one hand, central banks are tasked with limiting inflation, which requires a delicate act of restraining economic growth. On the other, they are expected to support employment, which calls for stimulating the economy. So how do these entities reconcile these seemingly opposing objectives? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a deeper look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spend less than you earn – invest the surplus – avoid debt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do simply this, and you&amp;rsquo;ll wind up rich. Not just in money. If your lifestyle matches or, god forbid, exceeds your income, you are no more than a gilded slave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As individuals, we only have one obligation to society: To make sure we and our children are not a burden to others. The rest is your personal choice. Make your own and make the world a far more interesting place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My highlighs of the book: &lt;strong&gt;59 Seconds: Think a little, change a lot&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Richard Wiseman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1---happiness&#34;&gt;Chapter 1 - Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We all get used to what we have very quickly. Buying a new car or a bigger house provides a short-term feel-good boost, but we quickly become accustomed to it and sink back to our pre-purchase level of joy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About 50 percent of your overall sense of happiness is genetically determined,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are my notes of &lt;strong&gt;Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;by Roger Fisher and William Ury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-dont-bargain-over-positions&#34;&gt;1 Don’t Bargain Over Positions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arguing over positions is inefficient&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bargaining over positions creates incentives that stall settlement. In positional bargaining you try to improve the chance that any settlement reached is favorable to you by starting with an extreme position, by stubbornly holding to it, by deceiving the other party as to your true views, and by making small concessions only as necessary to keep the negotiation going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes of the book:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;by Mnookin, Robert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, for an act to be evil, the perpetrator must intend to inflict harm. Carelessness is not enough. Second, the harm must be very serious. I use the word grievous to connote harms that are severe. Third, the infliction of harm must lack an adequate justification or excuse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;interests&#34;&gt;Interests&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are my interests? What are my adversary’s interests?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Efficient Market Hypothesis in the real world</title>
      <link>https://blog.miguens.one/posts/2020/02/the-efficient-market-hypothesis-in-the-real-world/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;higher-trading-profits-when-company-directors-trade-shares&#34;&gt;Higher trading profits when company directors trade shares&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This empirically-backed statement represents a violation of the strong-form efficient market hypothesis. Due to their privileged position and continuous engagement with the issuer, insiders have great access to information. This gives them a trading advantage and they outperform the risk-adjusted benchmark and other traders in the market. Please note that, in principle, insiders are allowed to trade legally. It is only in a situation when they are in possession of material non-public information that they have to refrain from trading. Strong-form EMH states that even undisclosed information should be already discounted in stock prices. If this was true, insiders would be unable to generate abnormal trading profits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Differences between the efficient market hypothesis and the behavioural finance approach</title>
      <link>https://blog.miguens.one/posts/2020/02/differences-between-the-efficient-market-hypothesis-and-the-behavioural-finance-approach/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://blog.miguens.one/posts/2020/02/differences-between-the-efficient-market-hypothesis-and-the-behavioural-finance-approach/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most substantial criticism of the EMH relies upon the assumption that all the investors are rational profit maximisers, and therefore, their investment is reasonable as well. Observations have shown that several investors are affected by herd instinct, a tendency to &amp;ldquo;churn&amp;rdquo; portfolios, to under-react or over-react to news and asymmetrical judgments about the causes of previous profits and losses.&#xA;With the concerns described above, a new theory was proposed based on psychology studies. The behavioural finance approach tries to find and explain the reason behind investors&amp;rsquo; behaviour, rather than assume their rationality like the EMH. In the behavioural approach, it is suggested that the investors could be prone to commit mistakes and errors originated by emotional and psychological forces and causing market anomalies (inefficiency in stocks markets) – e.g. the dot com bubble or the reactions seen in the recent global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Efficient market hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://blog.miguens.one/posts/2020/02/the-efficient-market-hypothesis/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-efficient-market-hypothesis&#34;&gt;The Efficient market hypothesis&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) goes back to 1900, but its popularity is attributed to Roberts (1967) and Fama (1970).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis defined the efficient market as a place where many rational individuals compete to maximise profit. In this market, all current and essential information is available free to all participants, while at the same time, there are no transaction costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The state of competition of intelligent participants leads to the situation where, at any point in time, the price of the stock reflects all past information, as well as any predictions of the future.&#xA;Fama (1970) identified three levels of efficiency of the market: the strong form, the semi-strong form and finally, the weak form of the EMH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alignment of managers’ actions and shareholders’ interests</title>
      <link>https://blog.miguens.one/posts/2020/01/alignment-of-managers-actions-and-shareholders-interests/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although there is no miraculous panacea, there are three main tools for dealing with the agency problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increasing disclosure requirements reduces the informational asymmetry between the agent and the principal, limiting managers&amp;rsquo; ability to prioritise their own selfish goals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Creating a close relationship between company performance and directors&amp;rsquo; remuneration. Their compensation package could be a function of the profits generated. Alternatively, directors could receive part of their compensation in stocks or call options, which would align their incentives with the shareholders&amp;rsquo; objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The introduction of corporate governance rules could, to some extent, force directors to act in the best interest of the company.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The area of corporate governance is defined as the rules that govern how the directors interact with each other inside the company for effective management and handle the directors&amp;rsquo; interactions with the shareholders&amp;rsquo; desired direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conflict of interest: Shareholders vs Managers</title>
      <link>https://blog.miguens.one/posts/2020/01/conflict-of-interest-shareholders-vs-managers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://blog.miguens.one/posts/2020/01/conflict-of-interest-shareholders-vs-managers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some stakeholders interest is not exclusively monetary. An example of such is &lt;a href=&#34;https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/resources/partnerships-in-fair-trade-reflections-from-a-case-study-of-cafe-direct-130427/&#34;&gt;Oxfam and Cafe Direct&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; initial pursuit of promoting the Fairtrade brand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above is not very common, and the working assumption is that the shareholders&amp;rsquo; objective is to maximise the wealth via the capital increase of the shares or the dividends. On the other hand, we should hypothesise that managers are more interested in their wealth and work security with the minimum effort possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamic capabilities in small software firms</title>
      <link>https://blog.miguens.one/posts/2018/06/dynamic-capabilities-in-small-software-firms/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.miguens.one/posts/2018/06/dynamic-capabilities-in-small-software-firms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I wish to summarise and critique a paper I found quite insightful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mathiassen, L. and Vainio, A. M. (2007) &amp;lsquo;Dynamic capabilities in small software firms: A sense-and-respond approach&amp;rsquo;, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, vol. 54, no. 3, pp. 522&amp;ndash;538 [Online]. DOI: 10.1109/TEM.2007.900782&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper describes two organisations in different phases of expansion. Both are in the category of small companies in the field of mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper starts by defining the object of study, small software firms, depending on integration and reconfiguration capabilities to operate in high-velocity markets. This type of companies&amp;rsquo; constraints is limited resources (schedule, fixed costs) and a high dependency on a few big players. The paper takes as a base the Sense-and-Respond approach to managing dynamic capabilities of Haeckel (1995). The study relies on interviews with CEOs, the Department Managers and Team Leaders of two firms with different levels of evolution, named &amp;ldquo;Starter, Inc&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mature, Inc&amp;rdquo;. Also introduces that successful adaptive organisations can monitor (Sense) environment signals quickly and translate into action (Respond) in three areas:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Discussion of Project Management Approaches for Ecological Vehicles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of a car manufacturer that wishes to create a network of recharging stations for its ecological vehicle, whatever it is electric or hydrogen cell-based, it will find some elements that it cannot fully control, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(1) Public reception of the new technology&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(2) Economic situation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(3) Public policies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those three factors are not the same in all countries and can even change inside the same country&amp;rsquo;s regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
